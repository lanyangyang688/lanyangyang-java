Lan Yangyang's Java Learning Journey

##   java-stage-one
Java beginner practice reference: Han Shunping and kuangshen's Java exercise problems

### 📚 Covered Topics  
#### 1. Han Shunping (HSP) Java  
- Variables, operators, conditional statements (if/switch), loops (for/while)  
- One-dimensional and two-dimensional arrays, array traversal, finding maximum and minimum values  
- Basic sorting algorithms: bubble sort  
- Classic examples: printing Pascal's triangle, array operation exercises 
#### 2. Crazy God Talks Java(Kuangshen)  
- Reinforce Java basics and syntax  
- Fundamental logic and introductory object-oriented practice 
#### 3. Exam paper  
- In-class synchronized basic coding exercises  
- Complete implementation of the final comprehensive project, including integrated logic, multi-class collaboration, and advanced array applications
##   java-stage-two
Java Advanced Object-Oriented & Core Fundamental Practice, covering advanced OOP features, enumerations, annotations, exceptions, wrapper classes and collection framework.

### 📚 Covered Topics
### Chapter1 Advanced Object-Oriented Programming
#### 1.Abstract Class
- Definition and usage rules of abstract classes and abstract methods
- Characteristics: cannot be instantiated, subclasses must implement abstract methods
- Template-oriented object-oriented design practice
#### 2.Interface
- Interface definition and implementation rules
- Interface constants, abstract methods, Java8 default/static methods
- Multi-implementation and multi-interface inheritance
- Comparison and scene selection of abstract class & interface
#### 3.Code Block
- Classification of code blocks: local code block, instance code block, static code block, synchronized code block
- Syntax writing & execution timing of each type of code block
- Execution order rule: static code block → instance code block → constructor → local code block
- Core functions & application scenarios of each code block
- Interview focus: static code block loading order under parent-child inheritance
#### 4.Inner Class
- Classification of inner classes: member inner class, static inner class, local inner class, anonymous inner class
- Access rules between outer class and inner class (mutual access of private members)
- Instantiation syntax of different inner classes
- Anonymous inner class: common usage with interfaces/abstract classes
- Application scenarios & memory structure features of inner classes

### Chapter2 Enums and Annotations
#### 1.Enum
#### 2.Annotation
#### 3.Exercise

### Chapter3 Exception

### Chapter4 Common Class
#### 1.Wrapper Class

### Chapter5 Collection
#### 1.

##   java-stage-three


### 🛠 Runtime Environment  
- JDK: JDK 8 / JDK 17  
- Development Tool: IntelliJ IDEA  
- No third-party frameworks, pure native Java code, ready to run out of the box 
### ▶ Code Execution Methods  
#### Method 1: IDEA (Recommended)  
1. Clone this repository to your local machine  
2. Open the project root directory in IDEA  
3. Right-click the target `.java` file → `Run 'Main'` 
#### Method 2: Compile and Run via Command Line
Compile all code and output to the bin folder javac -d bin src/**/*.java
## Execute a specified class (example) java -cp bin hsp-hanshunping.array-practice.BubbleSort
